always remember arrays are objects.

You can have objects in an Array. 
You can have functions in an Array. 
You can have arrays in an Array:

Associative Arrays
Many programming languages support arrays with named indexes.
Arrays with named indexes are called associative arrays (or hashes).
In JavaScript, arrays always use numbered indexes.

The Difference Between Arrays and Objects
In JavaScript, arrays use numbered indexes.  
In JavaScript, objects use named indexes.

Values in objects can be arrays, and values in arrays can be objects:

The at() method returns an indexed element from an array.
The at() method returns the same as [].

Note
Many languages allow negative bracket indexing like [-1] to access elements from the end of an object / array / string.
This is not possible in JavaScript, because [] is used for accessing both arrays and objects. obj[-1] refers to the value of key -1, not to the last property of the object.
The at() method was introduced in ES2022 to solve this problem.

Popping and Pushing
When you work with arrays, it is easy to remove elements and add new elements.
This is what popping and pushing is:
Popping items out of an array, or pushing items into an array.

Shifting Elements
Shifting is equivalent to popping, but working on the first element instead of the last.
