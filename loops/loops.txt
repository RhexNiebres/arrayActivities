  //forloop sample:
for (initializer; condition; final-expression) {
  // code to run
}

The keyword for, followed by some parentheses.

Inside the parentheses we have three items, separated by semicolons:

An initializer — this is usually a variable set to a number, which is incremented to count the number of times the loop has run. It is also sometimes referred to as a counter variable.
A condition — this defines when the loop should stop looping. This is generally an expression featuring a comparison operator, a test to see if the exit condition has been met.
A final-expression — this is always evaluated (or run) each time the loop has gone through a full iteration. It usually serves to increment (or in some cases decrement) the counter variable, to bring it closer to the point where the condition is no longer true.
Some curly braces that contain a block of code — this code will be run each time the loop iterates.
